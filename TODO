Pay attention that the the bookkeeper should be already adapted for the internal indices in the
tensor!!

Two options are possible to do this.

First, if the bond will be an internal index for ALL tensors at this stage, we can just 
straightforwardly update this symsec at this point.
( no need to recalculate the dimensions of the symsecs, since they are internal everywhere! ).
( I should thus best erase the dimensions maybe so I certainly can't use this ).

Second, I can also make a new symsec with a dummy bond at which it points too.
I dont think i need the second option atm.

Would it have a advantage to pick SU2 as last symmetry instead of PG?
